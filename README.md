Create Multiple Branches with Conflicting Commits
Long-running branches can create problems if not used intentionally. Sometimes a long-lived branch make sense for a development branch, or for other situations when you need  multiple levels of deployment-level code. Most of the challenges with long-running branches come from developers not having the most up-to-date version of each branch, creating needless merge conflicts, confusion, and work.
